# Algebra

Algebra at its core is made up of <b>terms</b> and <b>expressions</b>.

These are <b>terms</b>:
-	<b>Constant</b>: Value that doesn’t change i.e. 6, 70, -4, ⅘
-	<b>Variable</b>: A value that can change i.e. X, Y, α, ■
-	<b>Coefficient</b>: The constant multiplying a variable i.e. The 6 in 6x, ⅘ in ⁴ˣ⁄₅

<b>Expressions</b> are made of terms and operators. <b>Algebraic expressions</b> are expressions that use variables. <b>Polynomials</b>(poly meaning many) are expressions where every variable has a non-negative whole number as  a power. For example, each of these is both an <b>algebraic expression</b> and a <b>polynomial</b>:
-	8α²
-	4x - 2
-	-23y + 9z
-	2x² - 3x - 4

The <b>degree</b> of a polynomial refers to the highest power of a variable in the polynomial. The important degrees are:
-	<b>Linear(degree=1)</b>: 4x - 2
-	<b>Quadratic(degree=2)</b>: 2x² - 3x - 4
-	<b>Cubic(degree=3)</b>: x³ - 6x² + 11x - 6
-	<b>Quartic(degree=4)</b>: 3x⁴ - 2x³ + x² + 8

The <b>roots</b> of a polynomial are the values of the variable, when the polynomial = 0 in an equation, for example:
-	For x² - x - 6 = 0, x = -2 & x = 3.

Basic ideas:
-	Like terms with like terms. 
```     
    - Addition and subtraction between terms with the same variable to the same power i.e. 4x² + 6x² = 10x², whereas 4x² + 6x and 4x² + 6y² cannot be simplified.
```
-	Anything done to the one side of an equation is also done to the other. Consider 8x - 3 = 9. We have like terms that can be put together and simplified, namely -3 and 9. To do this, we can add 3 to both sides, following the laws of equality.
```
    8x - 3 = 9.
    8x - 3 + 3 = 9 + 3.
    8x = 12.
```
- Now to get x on its own, we can use the same principle. 8x means x multiplied by 8, so we must simply divide both sides by 8 to get our answer.
```
    x = 12/8.
    x = 4/3.
```
-	All terms can be multiplied/divided together.
```
    - When multiplying terms, all of the coefficients and variables are being multiplied together. For example (4x²)(6y²), is really (4)(x²)(6)(y²). The only multiplication we
        can do is (4)(6) = 24, therefore we get 24x²y² as our result. 
    - When dividing, the easiest method is to write one expression over the other, and divide whatever we can into both the bottom and the top. For example, 12x⁴ / 8y³ becomes 
        4x⁴ / 3y³, by dividing 2 into the top and the bottom. 
    - When multiplying terms with the same variable, we add their powers together. For example (4x²)(6x²), we can simplify (4)(6) to 24, and also (x²)(x²), to x² + 2, to x4. 
        This gives us 24x⁴. Similarly, when dividing we subtract the powers, for example 12x⁴ / 6x³ = 2x.
```
Expanding brackets: 
-	Multiplication is <b>distributive</b>. This means that when you multiply a term by an expression in brackets i.e. a(b + c), you can get the same answer by multiplying the first term by all terms in the brackets separately. So:
```
    - a(b + c) --> a(b) + a(c), or 
    - 3x(4x² - 6x) --> 3x(4x²) + 3x(-6x)
```
-	When multiplying an expression with another expression, we apply this concept multiple times. For example:
```
    (4x² + 6x)(3x - 4) --> 4x²(3x - 4) + 6x(3x - 4)
    4x²(3x - 4) + 6x(3x - 4) --> 4x²(3x) + 4x²(-4) + 6x(3x) + 6x(-4)
    12x³ - 16x² + 18x - 24x
    12x³ - 16x² - 6x
```
Factorising:
-	Factorising is the opposite of expanding brackets in many ways, where we take a polynomial and revert it to its <b>factors</b>.
-	Finding the <b>Highest Common Factor</b>. When possible, simply removing the HCF is an option. For example:
```
    - 4x + 10 --> 2(x + 5)
    - 5x² + x --> x(5x + 1)
    - 3xy + 6x² --> 3x(y + 2x)
```
-	When factorising quadratic expressions, we can make use of the <b>quadratic formula</b>, gives us the roots of quadratic expressions:

-	The factors of quadratic expressions are generally of the form (ax + b)(cx + d). For example: 
```
    - (x + 2)(x - 3) --> x² - x - 6.
    - (2x + 1)(x + 7) --> 2x² + 15x + 7
```
-	Therefore, when trying to solve an equation which equals 0, we know one of these factors must be equal to 0. Therefore by equating the factors to 0, we find that:
```
    - (x + 2)(x - 3) --> x² - x - 6.
    - x + 2 = 0 --> x = -2
    - x - 3 = 0 --> x = 3
    - For x² - x - 6 = 0, x = -2 & x = 3.
```
-   We can thus apply this method in reverse, using the quadratic formula to find the roots.
-	The <b>difference of two squares</b>. When an expression is in the form 
(ax)2 - (bx)2, we know its factors are ax + bx, and ax - bx. For example:
```
    - 4x² - 9 = (2x)² - (3)² --> (2x + 3)(2x - 3)
    - 16x⁴ - 1 = (4x2)² - (1)² --> (4x² + 1)(4x² - 1)
    - 4x² - 1 = (2x)² - (1)² --> (2x + 1)(2x - 1)
    - 4x² + 1 = (2x)² - (-1)² --> (2x - 1)(2x + 1)
```
Solving equations:
<b>Solving equations</b> can then be explained as finding the factors, and equating them to zero.
There are three main ways of solving quadratic equations. The most reliable method is to use the quadratic formula.
