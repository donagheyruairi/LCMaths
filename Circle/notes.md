# Circle

A circle at (0, 0) has the equation x² + y² = r². In this way a circle can be seen abstractly as a set of points a certain distance away from the centre point. This gives x and y a relationship that increases and decreases with respect to each other.

Radius is given by the answer to equation, as well as the coefficients of the terms.

A circle at (h, k) can have the equations:
    - (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r², with the radius r.
    - x² + y² - 2hx - 2ky - c = 0, with the radius √(h² + k² + c)
These are fundamentally the same formula. For example, for a circle at (2, 3) with radius 5:
(x - 2)² + (y - 3)² = 5²
x² - 4x + 4 + y² - 6y + 9 = 25
x² + y² - 4x - 6y - 12 = 0, where 5 = √(4 + 9 + 12) 

A circle can have up to 2 x-intercepts and y-intercepts. To find these, let the x and y axis 

To find if a point is within or outside a circle, sub the values into the equation for the circle. If the equation holds, the point is on the line, if the equation is less, it is inside. If more, it is on the outside.
